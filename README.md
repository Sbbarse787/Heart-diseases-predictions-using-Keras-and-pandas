# Heart-diseases-predictions-using-Keras-and-pandas
In this project we implemented a pandas for data exploration and keras 
for creating a neural netwrks. By using neural networks we created a
Machine learning model to detect the prediction of heart disease.

To Test the model we have to give a input array of 13 numbers.
